## Introduction

Have you ever had a cluttered folder full of files with different extensions and wished to organize them into separate directories based on their types? These scripts can help you achieve that!

## Scripts

### organize_files:

- `organize_files.py`: A Python script to organize files in a directory based on their extensions.
- `organize_files.bat`: A batch script to organize files in a directory based on their extensions.
- `organize_files.sh`: A shell script to organize files in a directory based on their extensions.

### move_files:

- `move_files_to_parent.sh`: This is a shell script that moves all files, including those in child directories, into the parent directory.
- `move_child_files_to_parent.sh`: This is a shell script that moves only the files from immediate child directories into the parent directory, without affecting files in grandchild directories..

### delete folders:

- `delete_empty_folders.sh`: A shell script to delete all empty folders recursively within a directory.
